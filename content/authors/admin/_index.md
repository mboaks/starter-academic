I work on developing high resolution 3D printing processes to bring the fabrication of lab-on-a-chip devices with microfluidic features (<100 Î¼m) out of high maintenance class 10 cleanroom to a custom 3D printer.Currently, I am a 3rd year PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Brigham Young University, Provo, UT. I work as a Research Assistant in the 3D printing for microfluidics lab under the supervision of Dr. Greg Nordin.

Prior to moving to Utah, I earned my Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering (MSECE) degree from Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) in May 2018. I investigated the feasibility of hydrogen storage in catalytically modified porous silicon in my master's thesis. I was the recipient of Distinguished Master's Thesis Award 2018 from Indiana University graduate school.

I love cooking traditional Bangladeshi food, road trips, and visiting US national parks during my spare time. So far I have visited 4 national parks. I intend to visit all the national parks in future.
