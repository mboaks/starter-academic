## Current Project

__3D printing for microfluidics with sub 10 micron thick layers__

In these project we are developing a new approach to be able to 3D print less than 10 micron thick layers for microfluidic applications. 

__Squeeze valve serial dilution and dose response assay__

In this project we intend to fabricate tiny serial dilution devices based on squeeze valves invented by our group. The application of this device will be a dose response assay. 


## Past Projects

__Biocompatible High Resolution 3D Printing for Microfluidics__     
Advisor: [Dr. Greg Nordin](https://ece.byu.edu/greg-nordin)

In this project, we developed a biocompatible and optically clear resin for high resolution 3D printed microfluidic devices for lab-on-a-chip application. We had to use a short pass filter to match the printer's source emission spectra to the absorber's absorption spectra. We printed active microfluidic components such as valves and pumps with this new resin. Finally, we fabricated a concentration gradient device with integrated 3D printed on-chip pumps and demostrated chemotaxis of human fibroblast cells towards a chemoattractant as an utility of the biocompatible resin. 

__Photonic Tuning of Silicon Ring Resonators Using an Automated Microfluidic Mixer__    
Advisor: [Dr. Ryan Camacho](https://camacholab.byu.edu/directory/ryan-camacho) & [Dr. Greg Nordin](https://ece.byu.edu/greg-nordin)

In this project, we developed a 3D printed microfluidic device that for the first time can automatically mix and pump fluids as needed to accurately modulate photonic ring resonators. We have published two journal papers based on the results from this project.

__Hydrogen Storage in Catalytically-Modified Porous Silicon__       
Advisor: [Dr. Peter Schubert](https://et.iupui.edu/people/pjschube)     

In this project, I investigated the kinetics of catalytically-modified porous silicon as a reversible hydrogen storage system using density functional theory (DFT) and compared the results to laboratory experiments. This project won me the  Graduate School Distinguished Masterâ€™s Thesis Award, Indiana University, 2018.
