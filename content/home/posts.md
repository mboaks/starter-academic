__8/2/2021:__ Our journal paper titled *"Post-fabrication Tuning of Micro-ring Resonators Using 3D-printed Microfluidics"* got accepted in Optics Letters.

__7/13/2021:__ Our abstract titled *"THE REST OF THE STORY: HIGH RESOLUTION 3D PRINTING WITH A BIOCOMPATIBLE RESIN FOR MICROFLUIDICS"* has been accepted for poster presentation in MicroTAS 2021. Another collaboration work with Dr. Wooley's group titled *"3D PRINTING MICROFLUIDIC DEVICES WITH CLEAR RESIN FOR 
ELECTROPHORETIC SEPARATION"* has also been accepted for poster presentation. 

__6/14/2021:__ Our journal paper titled *"Automated Photonic Tuning of Silicon Microring Resonators Using a 3D-printed Microfluidic Mixer"* got accepted in OSA Continuum.

__9/14/2020:__ Kevin Larson (MS student) presented our collaboration work in *Frontiers in Optics 2020* conference where we showed resonant frequencies of silicon ring resonators can be tuned using a custom 3D-printed microfluidic chip overlaid directly on the photonic circuit. We integrated 3D printed microfluidics with photonics in this project. This year the conference was virtual. 

__11/27/2019:__ I passed my PhD competency exam! 

__4/19/2019:__ Attended Indiana University Graduate School Award ceremony held at Indiana University, Bloomington campus. I received the **University Graduate School Distinguished Master's Thesis Award**.
